**Slider** is a sample game for GameThrone.js, my new HTML5 & Javascript game engine.

# Description

**Slider** is a sliding puzzle game where n tiles are laid out on a board x tiles wide and y tiles tall, where n is x * y - 1.
Tiles are numbered from 1 to n, so one possible arrangement is that of increasing order from the top-left to
the bottom-right, leaving the last square on the board empty.  This is the final state.
The player starts with a random arrangement of tiles and must slide tiles around the grid to reach the final state.
